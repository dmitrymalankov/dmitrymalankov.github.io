## Strategies for scaling out an application

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern
This pattern prevents a system from making calls to a failing service by wrapping it in a 'circuit breaker'. When the service fails, the circuit breaker trips, causing further calls to fail fast instead of trying to connect to a failing service repeatedly.

#### Bulkhead Pattern
This pattern isolates different components or services to prevent a failure in one part of the system from affecting others. It's similar to the bulkheads in a ship that prevent flooding in one compartment from sinking the entire vessel.

#### Retry Pattern
This pattern involves automatically retrying an operation that has failed due to transient errors. The retries are typically done with exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the system.

#### Rate Limiting Pattern
This pattern controls the number of requests a system or service can handle within a specific time window to prevent overload and ensure fair usage.

#### Failover Pattern
This pattern involves switching to a backup system or component when the primary one fails. It ensures continuity of service by having redundant systems ready to take over.
