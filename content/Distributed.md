## Caching in a distributed environment

In a distributed system, a distributed cache spans multiple nodes to provide high availability and scalability. It ensures that the cached data is consistent across the distributed environment and can handle the high throughput required by large-scale systems.

## Fault tolerance in distributed systems

#### Redundancy and Replication
*Data Replication:* Data is duplicated across multiple nodes or locations to ensure availability and durability. If one node fails, the system can still access the data from another node.
*Component Redundancy:* Critical system components are duplicated so that if one component fails, others can take over. This includes redundant servers, network paths, or services.

#### Failover Mechanisms
*Active-Passive Failover:* One component (active) handles the workload while another component (passive) remains on standby. If the active component fails, the passive component takes over.
*Active-Active Failover:* Multiple components actively handle workloads and share the load. If one component fails, others continue to handle the workload.

#### Error Detection Techniques
*Heartbeat Mechanisms:* Regular signals (heartbeats) are sent between components to detect failures. If a component stops sending heartbeats, it is considered failed.
*Checkpointing: Periodic* saving of the system's state so that if a failure occurs, the system can be restored to the last saved state.

#### Error Recovery Methods
*Rollback Recovery:* The system reverts to a previous state after detecting an error, using saved checkpoints or logs.
*Forward Recovery:* The system attempts to correct or compensate for the failure to continue operating. This may involve reprocessing or reconstructing data.


## Strategies for scaling out an application

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern
This pattern prevents a system from making calls to a failing service by wrapping it in a 'circuit breaker'. When the service fails, the circuit breaker trips, causing further calls to fail fast instead of trying to connect to a failing service repeatedly.

#### Bulkhead Pattern
This pattern isolates different components or services to prevent a failure in one part of the system from affecting others. It's similar to the bulkheads in a ship that prevent flooding in one compartment from sinking the entire vessel.

#### Retry Pattern
This pattern involves automatically retrying an operation that has failed due to transient errors. The retries are typically done with exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the system.

#### Rate Limiting Pattern
This pattern controls the number of requests a system or service can handle within a specific time window to prevent overload and ensure fair usage.

#### Failover Pattern
This pattern involves switching to a backup system or component when the primary one fails. It ensures continuity of service by having redundant systems ready to take over.
